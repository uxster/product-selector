# To all challengers!
Very cool to take up this challenge for making an awesome product selector. Your task is simple yet extensive; use Vue to create the most awesome selector ever. Make it pretty or make it functionally cool. Think about routing, state management but most of all, WOW us!

## The challenge (also software requirements)
Create a product selector that works for three different products from our catalogue.

### Goals
Let's see how far you can go!

1. Navigate via a menu to a product:
    - /product/posters
    - /product/folders
    - /product/businesscards
2. See a product selector with available options (see json files in this Repo).
3. Be able to select different options in the product
4. Add a product to a cart
5. Validate if the options is a possible option via the 'excludes' property.

This is ofcourse challenging!

## Getting started
Clone this repository. The only thing the repository contains is a JSON file with 3 products from our very own catalogue. You would first need to set-up [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html) in this repository.
